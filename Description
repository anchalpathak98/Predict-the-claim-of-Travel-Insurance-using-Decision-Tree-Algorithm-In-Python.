PREDICT THE CLAIM OF TRAVEL INSURANCE WHICH IS BASED ON THIRD PARTY SERVICING COMPANY LOCATED IN SINGAPORE USING DECISION TREE ALGORITHM IN PYTHON. Decision tree is one of the most popular machine learning algorithms used all among, this story I wanna talk about it so letâ€™s get started!!
We have couple of other algorithms there, so why do we have to choose decision tree?
Well, there might be many reasons but I believe a few which are-
1.	Decision trees often mimic the human level thinking so its so simple to understand the data and make some good interpretations.
2.	Decision trees actually  make you see the logic for the data to interpret.
Decision trees provide an effective method of decision making because they clearly lay out the problems so that all options can be challenged . Allow us to analyze fully the possible consequences of a decision. Provide a framework to quantify the values of outcomes and the probabilities of achieving them.
